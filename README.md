# Parabolic Reflector Dish Simulation

This project simulates the behavior of a parabolic reflector dish using a simple grid-based model. The simulation calculates the load distribution across the dish and performs various transformations on the dish's structure.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core 3.1 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or any compatible IDE

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parabolic-reflector-dish.git



Ensure you have an input.txt file in the project directory with the initial state of the dish.
Features
Grid-Based Model: Represents the parabolic dish in a 2D grid format.
Load Computation: Calculates the load distribution based on the dish's current state.
Rotation and Tilting: Simulates the tilting and rotation of the dish.
Long-Term Simulation: Predicts the dish's state after a large number of cycles.



## Installation
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving this simulation, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
