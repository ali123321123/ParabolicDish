# Parabolic Reflector Dish Simulation

This project simulates the behavior of a parabolic reflector dish using a simple grid-based model. The simulation calculates the load distribution across the dish and performs various transformations on the dish's structure.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Core 3.1 or later
- Visual Studio 2019 or any compatible IDE

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parabolic-reflector-dish.git


Usage
To run the simulation:

Ensure you have an input.txt file in the project directory with the initial state of the dish.
Run the program:
bash
Copy code
dotnet run
Features
Grid-Based Model: Represents the parabolic dish in a 2D grid format.
Load Computation: Calculates the load distribution based on the dish's current state.
Rotation and Tilting: Simulates the tilting and rotation of the dish.
Long-Term Simulation: Predicts the dish's state after a large number of cycles.
Code Overview
The main components of the code include:

Main(string[] args): Entry point of the program. Reads input, runs simulations, and prints results.
ComputeLoad(char[][] map): Calculates the load based on the dish's state.
Cycle(char[][] map): Simulates one complete cycle of dish transformations.
TiltNorth(char[][] map): Tilt the dish northward, simulating gravity's effect on the dish.
